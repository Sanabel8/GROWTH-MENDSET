How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?

He helped write the first web servers, he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser , He's smart.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

What does a GET do?
are almost universal
the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed

What does a POST do?
. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.
