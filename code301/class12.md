Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
                 	            
1.primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)    // primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment  

2. Give a real world example.  
MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data
- are highly preferred for large data set

4. Give a real world example.
  MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL database
6. Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
