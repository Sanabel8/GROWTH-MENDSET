1. What is a component?
Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties.
component is divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions.
component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
component is a software object, intended to interact with other components.

2. What are the charactistics of a component?

Characteristics of Components:
. Reusability 
. Replaceable
. Not context specific
. Extensible
. Encapsulated
. Independent 

3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
Advantages:
. Ease of deployment
. Reduced cost
. Ease of development
. Reusable
. Modification of technical complexity 
. Reliability
. System maintenance and evolution
. Independent 


* objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability and self-deployable binary unit. 
* Views of a Component:
1. object-oriented view 
2. conventional view
3. and process-related view.
* component can extend to other components and still offer its own extension points. It is the concept of plug-in based architecture. 
* Attains architectural component names from the problem domain and ensures that they have meaning to all stakeholders who view the architectural model.

What is props short for?
Props‚Äù is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties.
React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces.
* Its away to communicate between components and pass data between them.
* the data in Props  passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child) ,and props data is read-only 

How are props used in React?

* Using Props in React:
1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data

```class ParentComponent extends Component {  
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
        I'm the parent component.
        <ChildComponent />
      </h1>
    );
  }
}```
* we will write the value of child components in {}
```<ChildComponent someAttribute={value} anotherAttribute={value}/>```
* Passing Data using Props:
```const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
  return <p>I'm the 1st child!</p>; 
};```

* render 
*  Props returns back an object.
* in j.s to access the objects we will use dot(.)notation ,so to render the text we will use like ex
```const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
  return <p>{props.text}</p>; 
};```

What is the flow of props?
Passing props is very simple.
 Like we pass arguments to a function, we pass props into a React component and props bring all the necessary data.
