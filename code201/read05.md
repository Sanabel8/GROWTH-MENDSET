JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

* use JPEG format :contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.
* use PNG format : needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.
* Use GIF format : for images that contain animations.
* compression :reduce the size of data and ensure faster transmission.
* types of compression (lossless and lossy).
* JPEG :  is a lossy compression , achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without perception , best suited for photographs and paintings of natural scenes, donâ€™t support transparency .
* PNG is a lossless image format ,a great choice for images with text, logos and shapes with sharp edges ,  support transparency .
* GIF is also a lossless image format , mainly used only if the image contains animations,   support transparency .
