chapter 2

* every step in js  is clled statement and finish with ; like var color ='red'; each statment beign in anew line 
and a series of statment is called ascript.


* code blocks: set of statment inside the {}

* to write comments use // comment  for single comment  
                        /* comment */ for multible comments

* var use to store value for aname like var x=5;  or var colorCar = 'red';  or var y=8 ,z=9 ,x=y/z;
* we can change the value ot var in the code .

* data types :1.number as 55;
              2.string as 'sfd52$% '
              3.boolean  true or false.

* for string we can use '' or " " if have 'in the single qute should use \ before the ' or used the " "

* rulse foe variables:1.the name start with letter or - or $ .
                      2. in the name can't use key words
                      3. no var have the same name
                      4. use camel case for one more world 
* array used to store list of values are related to each other.
* array literal: to create the array var name [1vaue , 2value ,...]; 
or write like that 

colors= ['white', 
         'black', 
         'custom'];


* array constructor :
var colors =new Array('white ' , 
                      'black', 
                      'custom'); 
to changing the value on array colors[2]='beige';



EXPRESSIONS

1. one value to variable expressins like var name ="sanabel";

2. tow or more variable expressins like var area = 5*9;
 

OPERATORS 

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS =  +=  
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS + - * / ** %
STRING OPERATORS  BETWEEN " " OR ''
COMPARISON OPERATORS < > <= >= == === != !==
LOGICAL OPERATORS && !  II  the ansewr will be true or fulse

* concatenation to join onr more strings to gother using +

chapter 4


COMPARISON OPERATORS
 < less than 
 > greater than
 <= less than and equal
 >= greater than and equal
 == equal to only value
 === equal to value and type
 != not equal
 !== not equal 

structure for comparison operators (    <=    )
structure for using EXPRESSIONS and comparison operators (  +    )==(   +   )
structure for using EXPRESSIONS and comparison operators (  !=    )&&(   ==   )


if statment

if (condition) {

code 
}else if(condition ){
code;
 
}else{
code; 
}
* if the first condition is true will run the code if not will check else if condition if it true will ren the code if not will move to else .
