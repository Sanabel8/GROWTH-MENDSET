# Intro to Serverless
### What is Serverless Architecture? What are its Pros and Cons?
##  What is Serverless?
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. 
* Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).
* Here are some of the currently available cloud services:
1. AWS Lambda
2. Google Cloud Functions
3. Azure Functions
4. IBM OpenWhisk
5. Alibaba Function Compute
6. Iron Functions
7. Auth0 Webtask
8. Oracle Fn Project
9. Kubeless
*  But regardless the cool features of Serverless in some cases, the traditional architecture outshines it.
## Pricing
* One of the major advantages of using Serverless is reduced cost
*  The cost model of Serverless is execution-based: you’re charged for the number of executions.
* The winner here is Serverless Architecture.
## Networking
* The winner here is Traditional Architecture.
* This doesn’t have an impact on your pricing or process, but it means you cannot directly access them through the usual IP, snap!
## 3rd Party Dependencies
* The winner here is based on the context. For simple applications with few dependencies, Serverless is the winner; for anything more complex, Traditional Architecture is the winner.
## Environments
* The winner here is Serverless Architecture.
## Functions as a Service (FaaS)
* FaaS is an implementation of Serverless architectures where engineers can deploy an individual function or a piece of business logic.

* Principles of FaaS:
Complete management of servers
Invocation based billing
Event-driven and instantaneously scalable

* Key properties of FaaS:
Independent, server-side, logical functions
